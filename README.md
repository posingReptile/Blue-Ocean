### II. Description
  Shredded is an app for fitness enthusiasts and newbies alike. It is a one-stop shop for both exercise and meal planning that gives users a detailed overview of their upcoming meals and workouts, along with how many calories theyâ€™ll be consuming and burning every day.


### III. Project Overview

#### User authentication:  
  New users are required to create a user account with log-in details. Upon entering a username and password they will be prompted for further information about themselves that will aid in calculations required by the application. User sessions are stored in a PostgreSQL database to allow them to persist across different site visits.

#### Central Dashboard:
  The user will be able to see their workouts and meals for the day. From this dashboard, they can also access the add workout or add meal modals.

#### Workout & Meal Modal:
  The user will be able to see their workouts and meals for the day. From this dashboard, they can also access the add workout or add meal modals.

#### Calendar:
  The user can access a full-page calendar with each date square showing previews of the workouts and meals for the day. The right half of the screen will have a summary section showing the meals and workouts for the selected day, and clicking on any day in the calendar will display the meals and workouts for that day.

#### Nav Bar: 
  The nav bar will be visible on both the dashboard and the calendar pages, and will have options to add a meal, add a workout, go to the calendar, or go back to the dashboard. 

#### Profile Page: 
  The profile page will track personal records and allow the user to see/edit their current information. Personal records will be displayed for every workout. If the user is an admin they can also access admin message posting, and app metrics.
